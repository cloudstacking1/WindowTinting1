           <h4>
        Benefits of Window Tinting</h4>
        
                 <h5>
  1. UV Protection</h5>
           <p> Window tinting blocks up to 99% of harmful UV rays, protecting your skin and preventing your furniture from fading. Whether it?s residential or automotive, this feature is a game-changer.
          </p>
          <h5>2. Energy Efficiency

</h5>
          <p>Tinted windows help regulate indoor temperatures by reducing heat gain during the summer and retaining warmth in winter. This energy efficiency can lower your utility bills significantly.
</p>

          <h5>3. Enhanced Privacy

</h5>
          
          <p>With window tinting, you can enjoy your space without worrying about prying eyes. Our residential window tinting services in Boca Raton ensure maximum privacy while maintaining a sleek look.

</p>
         <h5>4. Increased Safety

</p>

         <h5>5. Aesthetic Appeal
